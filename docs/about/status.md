- [x] Sectoral damage data loading
- [x] Data providers with lazy loading and caching
- [x] Synthetic data generation for testing

### Testing

- [x] Unit tests for core functions
- [x] Integration tests for pipeline steps
- [x] End-to-end pipeline tests
- [x] Comparison tests with original implementation

## Validated Against Original

The implementation has been validated to produce numerically equivalent results to the original DSCIM library for:

- Damage reduction (all recipes)
- Damage function coefficients (OLS)
- Marginal damages calculation
- Discount factor calculation (constant, Ramsey, GWR)
- Final SCC values

Results match within floating-point tolerance (`rtol=1e-6`).

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope

The refactored implementation focuses on core SCC calculation functionality. Some features from the original are not yet implemented:

- [ ] Quantile regression for damage functions
- [ ] CAMEL sector aggregation
- [ ] ECS masking functionality
- [ ] AR5 climate scenarios
- [ ] USA-specific pathways

### Performance

- Synthetic data generation is for testing only (not production-ready)
- Large-scale parallelization has not been extensively tested
- Memory profiling for very large datasets pending
